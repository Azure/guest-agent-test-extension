# Sample Json file for the failCommands features. The extension will fail all the commands mentioned in this file with the specified ErrorMessage and the ExitCode.
# This feature is useful to test various failure cases and to ensure the agent is working fine
# TODO: Read these from the extension's public/private settings rather than a separate file for more flexibility
